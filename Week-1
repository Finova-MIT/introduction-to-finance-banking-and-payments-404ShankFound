Week-1

This week, I dived into the world of finance and discovered some eye-opening concepts that 
completely changed how I think about money. Among everything I learned, three ideas stood out the 
most: the Rule of 72, the magic of e in continuous compounding, and the Time Value of Money 
(TVM). These aren’t just abstract theories—they have real-world applications that can shape the way 
we manage our finances. 
The Rule of 72 is a surprisingly simple yet powerful trick for estimating how long it takes for an 
investment to double. Just divide 72 by the interest rate, and boom—you get the approximate 
number of years it will take. It’s a great reminder that the earlier we start investing, the more time 
we give our money to grow. 
Another mind-blowing concept was the role of e in continuous compounding. Unlike simple or 
periodic compounding, continuous compounding pushes growth to the max by applying interest 
infinitely within a given period. This is where Euler’s number comes in, showing the mathematical 
beauty behind financial growth. Understanding this can help make smarter choices about savings 
and investments. 
Then there Is the Time Value of Money (TVM), which drives home the point that money today is 
worth more than the same amount in the future because of its earning potential. This idea is at the 
heart of financial planning—whether it’s saving for retirement, evaluating an investment, or even 
deciding when to make a big purchase. 
Learning about these financial principles has reshaped how I see money. They highlight why it’s 
crucial to invest early, think strategically about finances, and make the most of compounding. With 
2025 around the corner, these lessons feel more relevant than ever.
